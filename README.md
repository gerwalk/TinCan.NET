This is a fork of the Tin Can API (also known as Experience API, or xAPI) for use in a Unity3D game.

Tin Can API for C#/.NET depends on Json.NET from Newtonsoft. When using Unity3D, you should use a modified, Unity-compatible build of Json.NET, such as one of the ones listed below. This fork of Tin Can API does not include any version of Json.NET, only modifications to Tin Can.
- Json.Net.Unity3D by SaladLab on GitHub: https://github.com/SaladLab/Json.Net.Unity3D OR
- JSON .NET for Unity by parentElement, LLC (which I've tested with) https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11347
